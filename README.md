This project is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that generates random cards with various measurements. The application features a button that allows the user to change the card displayed on the screen. Additionally, the application also has an automatic change feature enabled by a setInterval function, which changes the card displayed on the screen every 10 seconds. The cards displayed on the screen can be modified to various measurements, allowing the user to customize the size of the cards displayed. The application allowed me to practice using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create dynamic web content.
